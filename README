IO-Epoll version 0.01
=====================

The epoll(4) subsystem is a new, (currently) Linux-specific variant of
poll(2).  It is designed to offer O(1) scalability over large numbers of
watched file descriptors.  You will need at least version 2.5.44 of Linux
to use this module, and you might need to upgrade your C library.

The epoll(2) API comprises three system calls: epoll_create(2),
epoll_ctl(2) and epoll_wait(2).  IO::Epoll provides a low-level
API which closely matches the underlying system calls.  It also provides
a higher-level layer designed to emulate the behavior of IO::Poll>.
